          A link loan fund not only lowers the cost of education for qualified borrowers, it can deliver competitive returns, with shorter average life, than many other fixed income investments.

                %strong.field-title The federal government extends student loans to nearly 10 million individuals a year.
                %span.field-text Unlike a mortgage or auto loan, the government does not account for a borrower’s ability to repay their loan, issuing loans to high-risk borrowers at the same interest rate as loans issued to low-risk borrowers.  Link thinks this approach is unfair.

                %span.field-text If these factors suggest a borrower is low-risk, Link can offer the borrower a loan with a competitive interest rate.
